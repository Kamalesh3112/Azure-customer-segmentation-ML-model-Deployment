# Customer-segmentation-ML-model-in-Azure-Machine-Learning

A cloud based deployment project that was implemented using Microsoft Azure cloud service. This project is mainly focused about customer segmentation process using unsupervised machine learning algorithm called as **K-means Clustering**. I have developed this project in google colaboratory notebook and approached building the algorithm step by step as starting from Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to K-means algorithm with featuring of data visualization step to show the clusters around the centroid. As this is my **first cloud-based project** , after completing the algorithm , I have then moved to the cloud system called as Azure for using machine learning service to create an model and deploy it as the real time endpoint. I created a machine learning workspace for initial registration of my model with specifying resource group under the estimated location for configuration.

### What is Microsoft Azure?
> Azure is a vast cloud system that was developed by Microsoft by including many features like storage , networking , databases , AI & Machine Learning , Analytics , DevOps and many more to implement at large scale integration and development of the rapid growing technologies.

**Above is the list of the services that can be implemented for any projects at greater time of initiation.** As you cann see **Machine Learning** from Analytics and IoT core

## Let's take a look at about this project!

#### Customer segmentation

> It is the process of organizing customers into specific groups based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or preferences, with the aim of delivering more relevant experiences.

##### Algorithm used

> K-means Clustering algorithm used here in the project

**Programming language used in the notebook : Python**

### Cloud service : Microsoft Azure

**Services used from Azure**

- Compute Instances -> Virtual Machine
- AI & Machine Learning(Analytics) -> Machine Learning

**List of steps undergone in this project**

> Creating and configuringas following

- Computing instances.

- Configuring and deploying a virtual machine that is created.

- Machine Learning workspace.

- Directing to machine learning studio as the web version available. 

- Importing the model and performing testing & training in machine learning studio environment.

- Creating the endpoints and setting up the deployment specifications

- Finally deploying the machine learning model as the real time endpoint 

- Model has been deployed in the Azure ML environment

**Below are the sample screenshots of the services used in this deployment**
