# customer-segmentation-ML-model-in-Azure-Machine-Learning

A cloud based deployment project that was implemented using Microsoft Azure cloud service. This project is mainly focused about customer segmentation process using unsupervised machine learning algorithm called as **K-means Clustering**. I have developed this project in google colaboratory notebook and approached building the algorithm step by step as starting from Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to K-means algorithm with featuring of data visualization step to show the clusters around the centroid.
