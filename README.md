# customer-segmentation-ML-model-in-Azure-Machine-Learning

A cloud based deployment project that was implemented using Microsoft Azure cloud service. This project is mainly focused about customer segmentation process using unsupervised machine learning algorithm called as **K-means Clustering**. I have developed this project in google colaboratory notebook and approached building the algorithm step by step as starting from Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to K-means algorithm with featuring of data visualization step to show the clusters around the centroid. I have then moved to the cloud system called as Azure for using machine learning service to create an model and deploy it as the real time endpoint. I created a machine learning workspace for initial registration of my model with specifying resource group under the estimated location for configuration.

What is Microsoft Azure?
Azure is vast cloud system that was developed by Microsoft by including many features like storage , networking , databases , AI & Machine Learning , Analytics , DevOps and many more to implement at large scale integration and development of the rapid growing technologies.
